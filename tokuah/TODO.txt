** DELUXE VERSION TODO LIST **

- check levels for ability to jump at the top (they shouldn't hit
    an invisible ceiling unless there is supposed to be a ceiling there)

- py2exe, py2app -- get rid of lib.data.filepath and just use os.path.join ...
- f2 = toggle sound

- in boss level if you jump at the top of the screen you can
    go to part 2 w/o the boss
- make pandas killable with like 100 shots
    and if you kill one, you go to a secret level
- fix Tee's level - no win 
- add clear "Exit" signs to the end of levels
- overworld map ??
- every n points get the big hair
- add temp invincibility when you upgrade to new hair
    if you already have top hair, give a longer invincibility length?
- if you get an extra hair, you get a "2x hair" or "3x hair" ...
    which stays with you ..
