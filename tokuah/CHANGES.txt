(09:05:05 PM) pekuja: philhassey, I found a bug in moon-2
(09:05:50 PM) pekuja: philhassey, in the last screen, some of the floor tiles aren't, so you fall through the floor and die
(09:15:45 PM) pekuja: philhassey, apparentlsy the bottom right tile is missing for each of the tilesets... ;-(
- added a debug mode (press d on main menu to see all levels0
- remove the F12 "crash the game" key (ha ha ha)
